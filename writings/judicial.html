                <h3 class="text-center">JUDICIAL ACTIVISM RECONSIDERED</h3>
                <h4 class="text-center pb-3">by Thomas Sowell</h4>
                <p>Like many catchwords, "judicial activism" has acquired so many different meanings as to obscure more than it reveals.
                Yet it is not a term that can simply be ignored as intellectually "void for vagueness," for at the heart of it are
                concerns about the very meaning and survival of law. Abandonment of the term not being a viable option, clarification
                becomes imperative.</p>
                <p>"Judicial activism" and "judicial restraint" raise logically obvious but often ignored questions: Activism toward what?
                Restraint toward what? Are judges deemed to be activist or restrained toward (1) the current popular majority, (2) the
                legislature representing the current popular majority, (3) the statutes passed by present or past legislatures, (4) the
                acts of current of past executive or administrative agencies, (5) the meaning of the words in the Constitution, (6) the
                principles or purposes of those who wrote the Constitution, or (7) the legal precedents established by previous judicial
                interpretations of the Constitution?</p>
                <p>Activism or restraint toward one of these does not imply the same toward all the others, and may in some instances imply
                the opposite toward some other or others. For example, a "restrained" jurist, attempting to hold fast to the "original
                intentions" of constitutional provisions, must actively strike down statutes passed by a legislature which repeatedly
                over-steps the bounds of those provisions. Conversely, an "activist" jurist may passively accept expansive legislative
                action of a sort deemed consistent with general constitutional "values," even if lacking specific constitutional
                authorization or entering a "gray area" of constitutional prohibitions. One of the more striking examples of the latter
                was Justice William O. Douglas' repeated deference to the legislature in economic and social legislation, using language
                dear to the heart of those who believe in judicial restraint,<a id="one" class="scrollto" href="#n-1" alt="note 1"><sup>1</sup></a> though Douglas was a classic judicial activist.</p>
                <p>In the analysis that follows, the first priority will be to operationally distinguish judicial activism from judicial
                restraint, which involves focusing on the concept of "original intent." Only then is it possible to move on to the
                substantive issues dividing them. Finally, the prevailing image of "liberal, activist judges" will be questioned, the
                argument being that judicial activists have historically come in various political varieties.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">MEANING VERSUS "INTENT"</h4>

                <p>At the heart of the concern over judicial activism is the fear that the judge will impose his own personal preferences
                in his decisions, to such an extent as to ultimately negate the very meaning of law as a body of known rules to guide
                individual and social conduct. Formally, at least, both supporters and opponents of judicial activism deplore any such
                result, the former denying that this happens and the latter asserting that it does.</p>
                <p>Supporters of judges and justices labeled as judicial activists often assert that these jurists are restrained by the
                Constitution and are therefore necessarily active against individuals, groups, institutions, and policies in violation
                of constitutional provisions or principles. The empirical validity of this assertion is not an issue, at this point.
                Such assertions provide an area of common ground between critics and supporters of particular judicial practices, thus
                aiding in the definition of judicial activism. It is not mere activity or passivity that is at issue, but the basis of
                that activity or passivity. In a constitutional government, a jurist is said to be activist-- in the sense objected to--
                to the extent that he settles cases on grounds extrinsic to the Constitution. It is ultimately the Constitution toward
                which the jurist is "activist" or "restrained," though similar principles apply to the construing of statutes. The
                controversies which rage over judicial activism are controversies as to the extent to which jurists decide cases on
                grounds extrinsic to the Constitution, and in particular on grounds counter to the Constitution. That such decisions may
                also violate the popular will in some of its various meanings, or in its various manifestations through different
                government agencies, is another issue--important, but not necessary for the preliminary task of establishing
                definitions.</p>
                <p>The first order of business, then, is to distinguish (1) attempts to decide cases on grounds intrinsic to the
                Constitution, however easy or difficult this may prove to be in practice, from (2) attempts to use extrinsic
                considerations deemed to be of equal (or superior) value to the Constitution.</p>

                <h4 class="pt-3"><em>Intrinsic Considerations</em></h4>

                <p>One of the most obvious obstacles to following what the Constitution says is the difficulty of knowing what it says. The
                magnitude of this difficulty is crucial. No one believes that all cases can be disposed of, each with a unique solution,
                predetermined by "black letter law." Even the strongest advocates of "judicial restraint" present rules of
                interpretation which are implicit recognitions that obvious, all-encompassing, and uniquely predetermined solutions
                cannot be presupposed. However, it does not require a precise mathematical formula, specifying the location of a series
                of points, in order to know whether those points lie within certain boundaries. The real question is whether the jurist
                is searching for such boundaries or for escape from such boundaries-- whether what is involved in the interpretive
                process is a genuine dilemma or tactical agnosticism.</p>
                <p>In this context, the question as to what exactly the Constitution means by such phrases as "due process" or "privileges
                and immunities" would be relevant to specifying an infinite series of unique points, but not necessarily relevant to
                establishing boundaries, nor would lack of exactness preclude uniquely defined decisions in particular instances. It
                would be necessary to know exactly what constitutional provisions mean in all possible applications if the court were
                issuing comprehensive advisory opinions (defining an infinite series of unique points) but not when deciding each case
                seriatim (determining whether its particular conditions fall inside or outside relevant boundaries).</p>
                <p>The problem is not one of finding pinpoint meanings, universally applicable and uniquely determining the outcome of each
                case, but rather of finding boundaries of meaning for the issue at hand. The question is not what "cruel and unusual
                punishment" meant exactly, but whether the death penalty fell inside or outside its boundaries. Similarly, if a contract
                calls for an employment agency to supply an employer with "tall" men, clearly there is no exact meaning to this term,
                but if the agency consistently supplies men less than 5 feet high, there is no difficulty in determining that it has
                failed to live up to the contract. The question is not whether a term is comprehensively definitive but whether it is
                sufficient to dispose of the issue in the case at hand. Perhaps there are pigmy societies in which a man 4 feet 11
                inches high is considered "tall." But that is no reason to abandon the meaning of the term in American society and to
                seek extrinsic meanings or to declare that it has no possible meaning in any case.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, exactness is humanly unattainable, even in the simplest physical sense. No one knows exactly how far it is
                from the Washington Monument to the Tower of London. If the distance is given as an integer in miles, it can be rejected
                as inexact because it is not accurate to the inch, and if exact to the inch, then it can be rejected as not exact to the
                millimeter. If it is given fractionally rather than integrally, the exactness of the measuring instrument itself can be
                challenged as necessarily less than perfect. But notwithstanding all these difficulties in theory, in practice someone
                who did not know even the distance in miles would not hesitate to dismiss any claim that the Washington Monument was 10
                miles from the Tower of London-- or 10 million miles. Though few could specify the exact distance, all could dispose of
                these estimates as being outside the boundaries.</p>
                <p>The degree of difficulty in interpreting the Constitution or a statute depends upon what that task is conceived to
                consist of. Some of the interpretive rules suggested by those who urge judicial restraint provide clues to the
                interpretive process they envision--and, more important, shed light on what meaning to give to the phrase, "original
                intent." The point here is not to assess the merits of these rules but to consider what these rules imply as to the task
                being undertaken.</p>
                <p>Blackstone, for example, provided an explicitly numbered serial order of steps toward carrying out those "intentions at
                the time when the law was made." First, the words were "to be understood in their usual and most known signification."
                Simple as this may seem, it is a significant limitation-- a narrowing of the boundaries. It meant that the words of the
                law were not to be construed according to whatever meaning could with "propriety of grammar" be given to them, but
                rather according to "their general and popular use." Where "terms of art" or "technical terms" were involved, they were
                to be construed according to the meaning prevalent in the particular fields to which they pertained.<a id="two" class="scrollto" href="#n-2" alt="note 2"><sup>2</sup></a> In short, the
                judge was not to interpret the words de novo in whatever way grammar and the dictionary would permit, much less
                according to later beliefs or usage.</p>
                <p>Only when "words happen to be still dubious" was it permissible, according to Blackstone, to go on to the second step
                and try to "establish their meaning from the context." The context or "spirit" could not supersede the cognitive
                meaning. For Blackstone-- and, as we will see, for others-- it was the original cognitive meaning, not intent in the
                sense of psychological motivation or philosophical values, which was being sought.</p>
                <p>Even when Blackstone moved on to the third step in the interpretive process, determining what was "in the eye of the
                legislator," he used this only as a guide to the cognitive meaning of words still undetermined by the first two steps.
                Only where words still had no significance or "a very absurd signification" did Blackstone proceed to the fourth step in
                which "we must a little deviate from the received sense," so that a law, for example, against shedding blood in the
                street should not apply to a surgeon treating an injured man.<a id="three" class="scrollto" href="#n-3" alt="note 3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
                <p>It was only "lastly" in the process of "discovering the true meaning of a law, when the words are dubious" that the
                judge was justified in "considering the reason and spirit of it" or "the cause which moved the legislator to enact it."<a id="four" class="scrollto" href="#n-4" alt="note 4"><sup>4</sup></a>
                In all these steps, singly and collectively, the judge's role was the carrying out of instructions, with a meaning
                already given, whether given clearly or in a manner requiring further steps of discovery. It did not involve conceiving
                new meanings, whether based on later insights, judicial conscience, or the philosophical values presumed to motivate the
                original law.</p>
                <p>To Oliver Wendell Holmes, as to Blackstone, the cognitive meaning of laws as instructions took precedence over the
                psychological motivations or philosophical values of the writers of laws-- or of contracts, for that matter, for
                "parties may be bound by a contract to things which neither of them intended."<a id="five" class="scrollto" href="#n-5" alt="note 5"><sup>5</sup></a> Legal interpretation of what someone
                said did not mean, for Holmes, trying to "get into his mind."<a id="six" class="scrollto" href="#n-6" alt="note 6"><sup>6</sup></a> When a legal document "does not disclose one meaning
                conclusively according to the rules of the language," Holmes said, the question was "not what this man meant, but what
                those words would mean in the mouth of a normal speaker of English, using them in the circumstances in which they were
                used."<a id="seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-7" alt="note 7"><sup>7</sup></a> He said: "We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means."<a id="eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-8" alt="note 8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
                <p>Since it is flesh-and-blood people who have "values" and motivations, while statements may have logic and meaning,
                Holmes clearly was searching for cognitive meaning rather than philosophical, psychological, or other antecedents, much
                less the later values and insights of others. "I do not expect or think it desirable that judges should undertake to
                renovate the law," he said. "That is not their province."<a id="nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-9" alt="note 9"><sup>9</sup></a> Like Blackstone, Holmes would, as a last resort, try to "read
                what the writer meant into what he tried but failed to say"-- as for example, when a contract was made in which each
                party designated a different ship by the same name.<a id="ten" class="scrollto" href="#n-10" alt="note 10"><sup>10</sup></a> But, in general, when judges "interpret and apply the words of a
                statute, their function is merely academic to begin with-- to read English intelligently-- and a consideration of
                consequences comes into play, if at all, only when the meanings of the words used is open to reasonable doubt."<a id="eleven" class="scrollto" href="#n-11" alt="note 11"><sup>11</sup></a> Once
                again, this is a sequential process of interpretation, with the sequence stopping whenever the original meaning is
                found, other considerations-- whether philosophical or psychological antecedents or subsequent results-- becoming moot
                at that point. When interpreting the Sixteenth Amendment, Holmes expressed the belief that its words should be read in
                "a sense most obvious to the common understanding at the time of its adoption."1<a id="twelve" class="scrollto" href="#n-12" alt="note 12"><sup>12</sup></a> Similarly, he refused to declare
                unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment "methods of taxation which were well known when that Amendment was
                adopted."<a id="thirteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-13" alt="note 13"><sup>13</sup></a> Here as elsewhere, what was being sought was original cognitive meaning. Like Blackstone, Holmes declared
                that meaning "is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary," but by observing their historical,
                contextual meaning.<a id="fourteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-14" alt="note 14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
                <p>It may seem inconsistent for Holmes to have been an advocate of judicial restraint, given his oft-quoted comments on
                "the legislative function of the courts"<a id="fifteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-15" alt="note 15"><sup>15</sup></a> in his classic, The Common Law. However, Holmes' own words must be read in
                context, as he urged in the reading of others' words. To write of the common law-- by definition, judge-made law-- as
                having been made by judges is by no means to take a controversial position, much less an activist one. Nor was there
                even a change of mind on this point involved between this and Holmes' later views. In the very same paragraph in which
                he argued that it was not the province of judges to "renovate the law," Holmes also declared that "judges are called on
                to exercise the sovereign prerogative of choice"-- in "doubtful" cases.<a id="sixteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-16" alt="note 16"><sup>16</sup></a> He continued over the years to speak of
                judges' making "some profound interstitial change in the very tissue of the law."<a id="seventeen" class="scrollto" href="#n-17" alt="note 17"><sup>17</sup></a> He said: "I recognize without
                hesitation that judges do and must legislate, but they can do so only interstitially; they are confined from molar to
                molecular motions."<a id="eighteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-18" alt="note 18"><sup>18</sup></a> This was not advocacy of even "a little" judicial activism, as that term is used here. Judges
                acted in interstices left vacant by explicit legislation and constitutional provisions. At no point were they authorized
                to supersede either by extrinsic sources of judicial decisions.<a id="nineteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-19" alt="note 19"><sup>19</sup></a> While judges were to take the public interest into
                account when making their interstitial choices, such considerations had no place when weighing explicit legislation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I think the proper course is to recognize that a State legislature can do whatever it sees fit to do unless it is
                    restrained by some express prohibition in the Constitution of the United States or of the State, and that courts should
                    be careful not to extend such prohibitions beyond their obvious meaning by reading into them conceptions of public
                    policy that the particular court may happen to entertain.<a id="twenty" class="scrollto" href="#n-20" alt="note 20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, judges were not to expand their interstices. Nor was this merely a pious generality. In practice, Holmes
                repeatedly dissented from expansive readings of the Fourteenth Amendment,<a id="twenty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-21" alt="note 21"><sup>21</sup></a> deprecating "the use of the Fourteenth
                Amendment beyond the absolute compulsion of its words."<a id="twenty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-22" alt="note 22"><sup>22</sup></a> In statutory construction, Holmes likewise declared that he
                saw "no reason for reading into the Sherman Act more than we find there."<a id="twenty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-23" alt="note 23"><sup>23</sup></a> In his first dissent on the U.S. Supreme
                Court, Holmes read the Sherman Act so narrowly as to deny that it protected competition in the market-place.<a id="twenty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-24" alt="note 24"><sup>24</sup></a> Holmes'
                most famous rejection of extrinsic sources of law was of course his declaration: "The Fourteenth Amendment does not
                enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics."<a id="twenty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-25" alt="note 25"><sup>25</sup></a> This was not a rejection of Spencer's economic or social philosophy, to
                which Holmes' own views bore considerable resemblance.<a id="twenty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-26" alt="note 26"><sup>26</sup></a> The point was simply that Holmes practiced what he so often
                preached, that his own personal opinions and philosophy were irrelevant to the legal issues at hand.<a id="twenty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-27" alt="note 27"><sup>27</sup></a> He sometimes made
                devastating dismissals of the views of people whose cases he supported with his vote.<a id="twenty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-28" alt="note 28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
                <p>The themes elaborated by Blackstone and Holmes continue to be echoed by contemporary advocates of judicial restraint.
                For example, the self-disciplined judge, according to Richard Posner "is the honest agent of others until the will of
                the principals can no longer be discerned."<a id="twenty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-29" alt="note 29"><sup>29</sup></a> In short, the jurist is carrying out instructions, not synthesizing
                decisions from the raw material of "values." In Raoul Berger, the "original intentions" of the framers of the
                Constitution is given a cognitive rather than a psychological-- or philosophical-- motivation definition as "the meaning
                attached by the framers to the words they employed in the Constitution and its Amendments."<a id="thirty" class="scrollto" href="#n-30" alt="note 30"><sup>30</sup></a> Judge Robert H. Bork has
                likewise argued that judges should render decisions "according to the historical Constitution."<a id="thirty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-31" alt="note 31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
                <p>In summary, judicial activism and judicial restraint are defined here in terms of activism or restraint toward the
                written law-- constitutional or statutory-- in the cognitive meaning it had when enacted. That meaning need not be
                pinpointed. In practice, the question is whether issues raised in a given case fall inside or outside the boundaries of
                that cognitive meaning. To advocates of judicial restraint, the phrase "original intent" is simply a convenient label
                for that cognitive meaning as enacted into law. The psychology or philosophy of the writers has no weight, as against
                that of the cognitive meaning, and is resorted to only in aid of an elusive meaning. Because "original intent" is a
                shorthand label for the views of the advocates of judicial restraint, its meaning is taken from them rather than from
                their adversaries. Arguments from their adversaries are of course relevant and will be considered in due course, but the
                definition of what is being advocated must be that of the advocates.</p>

                <h4 class="pt-3"><em>Extrinsic Considerations</em></h4>
                <p>Extrinsic considerations enter the interpretation of law because (1) some jurists do not choose to interpret within the
                confines of intrinsic meanings and because (2) there are gaps in law and language which must be filled in from extrinsic
                sources (Holmes' "interstitial" judicial legislation). Inasmuch as the second reason applies to even the most judicially
                restrained jurist, only the first is judicial activism in the sense that is controversial, the sense defined above.</p>
                <p>Advocates of judicial activism urge that extrinsic meanings be used, even if intrinsic meanings are known. Ronald
                Dworkin, for example, rejects a "strict interpretation" of the constitutional text because it limits constitutional
                rights "to those recognized by a limited group of people at a fixed date of history."<a id="thirty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-32" alt="note 32"><sup>32</sup></a> It would be wrong, according to
                Dworkin, in interpreting the constitutional phrase, "cruel and unusual punishment" for the Supreme Court "to be much
                influenced by the fact that when the clause was adopted capital punishment was standard and unquestioned."<a id="thirty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-33" alt="note 33"><sup>33</sup></a> Dworkin
                argued:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>That would be decisive if the framers of the clause had meant to lay down a particular conception of cruelty, because it
                    would show that the conception did not extend so far. But it is not decisive of the different question the Court now
                    faces, which is this: Can the Court, responding to the framers' appeal to the concept of cruelty, now defend a
                    conception that does not make death cruel?<a id="thirty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-34" alt="note 34"><sup>34</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this view, "the Court can enforce what the Constitution says only by making up its own mind about what is cruel.''<a id="thirty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-35" alt="note 35"><sup>35</sup></a>
                More generally, "rights may vary in strength and character from case to case, and from point to point in history."<a id="thirty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-36" alt="note 36"><sup>36</sup></a>
                Dworkin called for "a fusion of constitutional law and moral theory."<a id="thirty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-37" alt="note 37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
                <p>Morality, as such, is not inherently extrinsic to the Constitution, even on Holmes' view. "The law is the witness and
                external deposit of our moral life," he said.<a id="thirty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-38" alt="note 38"><sup>38</sup></a> It is the judge's morality (or the judge's conception of society's
                morality) which is extrinsic to the Constitution. The case for recognizing that there is morality in law is not a case
                for judges' introducing morality into law. When Holmes defined law as essentially a "prediction of the incidence of the
                public force,"<a id="thirty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-39" alt="note 39"><sup>39</sup></a> he also denied that this was "the language of cynicism,"<a id="forty" class="scrollto" href="#n-40" alt="note 40"><sup>40</sup></a> for when he emphasized "the difference
                between law and morals," he did so "with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law."<a id="forty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-41" alt="note 41"><sup>41</sup></a> Law
                was not to be interpreted by moral criteria, but as a set of instructions whose cognitive meaning was pre-emptive.</p>
                <p>By contrast, those who argue for a larger interpretive role for judges seek to go behind the cognitive meaning. To them,
                "original intent" encompasses the psychological state of mind of those who wrote the Constitution-- the fact that
                Madison "approached the Convention in the grip of a great intellectual passion,"<a id="forty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-42" alt="note 42"><sup>42</sup></a> that he had "fear" of certain
                policies regarding property and religion,<a id="forty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-43" alt="note 43"><sup>43</sup></a> or that he "privately described" constitutional amendments in a particular
                way.<a id="forty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-44" alt="note 44"><sup>44</sup></a> Professor Dworkin argues at considerable length against original intent on grounds that the "mental events" in
                the minds of legislators or writers of the Constitution are difficult or impossible to discern,<a id="forty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-45" alt="note 45"><sup>45</sup></a> that "it seems even
                plainer that we have no fixed concept of a group intention," nor any way of deciding "which aspects of individual mental
                states are relevant to a group intention."<a id="forty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-46" alt="note 46"><sup>46</sup></a> In a similar vein, others point out that "public statements often do not
                reflect actual intentions."<a id="forty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-47" alt="note 47"><sup>47</sup></a> In contrast to Holmes, this is indeed trying to get inside people's minds.</p>
                <p>Given the expansive nature of the task conceived, the great difficulties and ambiguities-- not to say utter
                impossibility-- of discerning "original intent" are indeed what the advocates of judicial activism claim. But it is not
                this kind of original intent which has been proposed. It is only when going behind cognitive meaning that original
                intent would require modern interpreters to "discern exactly what the Framers thought," as Justice William J. Brennan
                claims. Within his framework, it is relevant to point out that "the Framers themselves did not agree" on all provisions
                of "a jointly drafted document," and its enactment involved not only "the drafters" but also "the congressional
                disputants" and "the ratifiers in the states."<a id="forty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-48" alt="note 48"><sup>48</sup></a> But the relevance of such considerations depends entirely on the
                framework adopted and the task it implies-- a framework not adopted and a task not undertaken by advocates of "original
                intent" or judicial restraint.</p>
                <p>These great-- if not insuperable-- interpretive difficulties do not derive from the Constitution itself or from
                deficiencies of the historical record, and would apply even to an ordinary commercial contract or employment agreement
                made today. If a judge were to seek out the "aspirations" behind a decision to embark on a particular career or the
                "substantive values" embodied in establishing one corporate structure rather than another, his interpretive task would
                be equally formidable. Instead of determining the cognitive meaning of the terms and conditions set forth in a contract,
                he would have to consider the subjective intentions and motivations, not only of the attorneys who drew up the relevant
                documents, but also of the executives who directed them, the stockholders (vocal and passive), investment bankers with a
                stake in the company, labor union officials, and others whose influence was felt one way or another in the emergence of
                the document in question. It is only by focusing on cognitive meaning that the interpretive task becomes manageable for
                the judge-- or so manageable that it need not come before a judge.</p>
                <p>A specific and real case may illustrate concretely the distinction between seeking the cognitive meaning of instructions
                and going beyond cognitive meaning to extrinsic considerations. The Weber case<a id="forty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-49" alt="note 49"><sup>49</sup></a> provides such an illustration. Section
                703(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it illegal for an employer "to discriminate against any individual with
                respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race" or
                various other characteristics. Section 703(d) more specifically forbade such discrimination in "any program established
                to provide apprenticeship or other training." A white employee, Brian F. Weber, was denied admission to a training
                program where places were awarded on the basis of seniority, even though black employees with less seniority were
                admitted, because racially separate seniority lists were used and racial quotas were established. That this was counter
                to the plain cognitive meaning of the Act was not explicitly denied in the U.S. Supreme Court opinion written by Justice
                William J. Brennan. But Justice Brennan rejected "a literal interpretation" of the Civil Rights Act, preferring instead
                to seek the "spirit" of the Act in Congress' "primary concern" for "the plight of the Negro in our economy."<a id="fifty" class="scrollto" href="#n-50" alt="note 50"><sup>50</sup></a> In short,
                he went behind the cognitive meaning of the law's provisions to the presumed purposes and values motivating the
                enactment of the law. Because that presumed purpose was not to protect whites from racial discrimination, the Act was
                deemed not to protect Brian F. Weber, who lost the case. The emergence of this decision from the clear language of the
                Act to the contrary was likened to the great escapes of Houdini, in the dissenting opinion of Justice William H.
                Rehnquist.<a id="fifty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-51" alt="note 51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
                <p>The Weber case illustrates the difference between seeking intrinsic cognitive meaning and going beyond that meaning to
                extrinsic considerations because (1) there was no serious question as to the cognitive meaning of the words, so that (2)
                the kinds of interpretive steps suggested by Holmes and Blackstone, among others, were unnecessary for the purpose of
                advancing toward the cognitive meaning-- and were, on the contrary, used to advance beyond cognitive meanings, in the
                manner suggested by Ronald Dworkin.</p>
                <p>Professor Dworkin in fact endorsed the Weber decision. Citing "the background of centuries of malign racial
                discrimination,"<a id="fifty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-52" alt="note 52"><sup>52</sup></a> Dworkin referred to the Civil Rights Act as "a decision by Congress to advance racial equality," so
                that this "underlying policy" made Brennan's decision the right one.<a id="fifty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-53" alt="note 53"><sup>53</sup></a> According to Dworkin, "the question of how Title
                VII should be interpreted cannot be answered simply by staring at the words Congress used."<a id="fifty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-54" alt="note 54"><sup>54</sup></a> Yet he did not claim that
                the specific words actually used were unclear as to cognitive meaning, though he proceeded to discuss a hypothetical
                case of what to do when statutory language was in fact "unclear."<a id="fifty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-55" alt="note 55"><sup>55</sup></a> Tactical agnosticism can of course make any words
                unclear, and hypothetical cases are a very effective way of doing so. But in the actual case under discussion, there was
                no claim that Congress had exempted affirmative action plans from the Act or (as in the case of the surgeon shedding
                blood in the streets) simply not contemplated the particular situation referred to when writing the statute.<a id="fifty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-56" alt="note 56"><sup>56</sup></a> Such
                questions are relevant to attempts to advance toward the cognitive meaning given by the legislators, but they are not
                relevant to the interpretive process proposed by Dworkin:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One justification for a statute is better than another, and provides the direction for coherent development of the
                    statute, if it provides a more accurate or more sensitive or sounder analysis of the underlying moral principles. So
                    judges must decide which of the two competing justifications is superior as a matter of political morality, and apply
                    the statute so as to further that justification."<a id="fifty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-57" alt="note 57"><sup>57</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>All this was said in exploring a hypothetical case, but the results of the reasoning were then referred back to the
                Weber case, whose decision Dworkin then approved as "another step in the Court's efforts to develop a new conception of
                what equality requires in the search for racial justice."<a id="fifty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-58" alt="note 58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
                <p>The tactical ingenuity of Professor Dworkin's discussion of the Weber case with reference to a hypothetical case of
                unclear meaning cannot be fully appreciated without knowing that (1) far from being a situation not contemplated by the
                legislators (like the surgeon shedding blood), the possibility of racial quotas and reverse discrimination against white
                individuals was raised often and insistently by congressional critics of the Civil Rights Act in the debates leading up
                to its passage, and (2) were equally often and emphatically rejected by the Act's supporters as being neither the
                purpose of the Act nor even permitted by the Act.<a id="fifty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-59" alt="note 59"><sup>59</sup></a> Had Dworkin discussed the Weber case specifically throughout his
                consideration of it, and had he made the explicit claim that the language of the Act was cognitively unclear in its
                application to the case at hand, that would have opened up a search for cognitive clarification, which would have turned
                up these embarrassing results.</p>
                <p>Tactical agnosticism and an escape into the hypothetical are by no means peculiar to Professor Dworkin, or even to
                analyses of particular cases. A general argument has often been made that times and circumstances have changed, thereby
                necessarily changing the meanings of constitutional provisions. This is almost never said in the context of a
                particular, concrete case at hand, requiring a particular provision to be superseded as manifestly inapplicable to the
                circumstances of the litigants. More commonly, hypothetical cases are posited, involving technological or other changes
                unforeseeable by the framers of the Constitution, thereby arguing for a general difficulty of following original
                meanings. Ironically, this general argument from hypothetical cases has virtually no applicability to the most
                controversial Supreme Court cases of the past generation, which dealt with things well known at the time the
                Constitution was adopted-abortion,<a id="sixty" class="scrollto" href="#n-60" alt="note 60"><sup>60</sup></a> prayer in school,<a id="sixty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-61" alt="note 61"><sup>61</sup></a> the arrest of criminals,<a id="sixty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-62" alt="note 62"><sup>62</sup></a> the segregation of the races,<a id="sixty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-63" alt="note 63"><sup>63</sup></a>

                social conditions in the nation is not to assert that the law is unclear, unless one's proclaimed agnosticism is in fact
                purely tactical. When Justice Brennan said "ambiguity of course calls forth interpretation,"<a id="sixty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-66" alt="note 66"><sup>66</sup></a> he ignored the more
                fundamental question, whether it was interpretation which called forth ambiguity.</p>
                <p>The case for extrinsic considerations in interpretation of law can be made independently of claims of cognitive
                ambiguity, though it seldom is. More commonly, there are protestations of the great difficulties of determining what the
                writers of the Constitution meant-- followed by assertions that such meanings are now obsolete anyway. But if the case
                for extrinsic meanings is valid, the difficulties of finding intrinsic meanings are irrelevant. The whole argument thus
                reduces to one of the substantive merits of the case for going beyond cognitive meanings in the law.</p>

                <h4 class="pt-3 text-center">SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES</h4>
                <p>Among the reasons advanced for going beyond the "original intent" (cognitive meaning) of those who enacted legislation
                or constitutional provisions is that (1) there have been significant social changes since the enactment, (2) there are
                moral questions involved, only imperfectly addressed or cryptically suggested by the explicit language of the enactment
                and, more generally, the enactment-- especially the Constitution-- is not to be read as a set of rules but as an
                expression of values, to be given specific content in the particular case by the jurist. Those on the other side, who
                propose remaining within the original cognitive meaning, often raise another issue as to (3) the right of a democratic
                majority to govern through its representatives. These arguments will be considered in turn.</p>
                <p>"Change"</p>
                <p>Advocates of judicial activism often refer to changes which have taken place, and others deemed desirable, as reasons
                for going beyond the original cognitive meanings of laws, including the Constitution. According to Justice William J.
                Brennan:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Those who would restrict claims of right to the values of 1789 specifically articulated in the Constitution turn a blind
                    eye to social progress and eschew adaptation of overarching principles to changes of social circumstances.<a id="sixty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-67" alt="note 67"><sup>67</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>According to Justice Brennan, "the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a
                world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current
                needs."<a id="sixty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-68" alt="note 68"><sup>68</sup></a> Similar views can be found throughout a vast literature, inside and outside the legal profession, at both
                scholarly and popular levels.</p>
                <p>The repeated and insistent emphasis on the fact of "change"-- surely one of the most common and uncontroverted features
                of human history-- is difficult to understand, except as a prelude to the non sequitur that judges are the special,
                authorized agencies of particular changes favored by the particular advocates. Generic "change" is simply not a
                controversial issue. Even individuals commonly identified as "conservative" often have a breath-taking range of changes
                which they would like to see introduced-- differing in specifics, more so than in number or magnitude, from the changes
                advocated by those considered "liberal" or "radical."</p>
                <p>Technological or other changes which literally render it impossible to meaningfully apply constitutional provisions in
                their original senses-- electronic listening devices or aerial surveillance, for example-- have seldom been involved in
                the constitutional cases which have produced firestorms of controversy. Nor have the objective "social changes" which
                have occurred usually been such as to make existing laws impossible to apply-- as massive miscegenation might have
                rendered racial segregation laws administratively untenable, for example. What has more commonly happened is that
                changes in subjective attitudes and beliefs-- among judges, intellectuals, or the public at large-- have weakened or
                displaced faith in the desirability of various laws and social conditions. Whatever the merits and validity of these
                subjective changes, they are not objective compulsions which judges "cannot avoid" which compel them, against all their
                misgivings, to try to "penetrate to the full meaning of the Constitution's provisions," as Justice Brennan depicts it.<a id="sixty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-69" alt="note 69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
                <p>In short, whatever hypothetical tyranny "change" might exercise over reluctant judges in hypothetical cases-- in the
                real world, the real cases which have caused concern and controversy over judicial activism have seldom been of this
                nature. Social change created no cognitive difficulties in determining Brian Weber's race or that of his fellow
                employees, or made the language of Sections 703(a) or 703(d) of the Civil Rights Act shrouded in ambiguity defying all
                attempts to discern what Congress could possibly have meant. The changing technology of abortions raised neither
                administrative nor other barriers to the feasibility of its being either legal or illegal. Nor were any of the
                eighteenth-century methods of execution, which escaped the "cruel and unusual" prohibition of the Constitution at the
                time, lost as options through "change" in the intervening generations. In short, feasibility is not the central issue.
                What has changed most profoundly is what people, including judges, wish to do.</p>
                <p>Once the argument is disencumbered of tactical agnosticism, feasibility, and generic "change," the issue can be faced as
                to how to institute such specific changes as seem desirable. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States
                to prevent this, despite many laments as to the "difficulty" of amending the Constitution. Difficulty must be
                distinguished from frequency. It is not difficult to put on one red shoe and one green shoe each morning, but it happens
                infrequently-- because people do not wish to do so. The statistical frequency with which the Constitution is amended is
                relevant only when compared to the frequency with which the public wishes it to be amended. The fact that it is
                considered a damning charge against judges that they are de facto amending the Constitution-- and that judges feel
                called upon to deny it-- suggests that the public is more anxious to prevent the Constitution from being changed than to
                change it. If this evidence is insufficient, it nevertheless exceeds evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the hallmark of
                the opposite view is that evidence is neither asked nor given as to the differential between desired and actual
                amendment-- i.e., the "difficulty" of the amending process.</p>
                <p>Discussions of how rarely the amending process has been "successful"<a id="seventy" class="scrollto" href="#n-70" alt="note 70"><sup>70</sup></a> implicitly define success as the adding of an
                amendment rather than the carrying out of the public's will. By this standard, the electoral process must also be
                considered an abysmal failure, because far more candidates are defeated than elected, especially if primary elections
                are counted. But in both the electoral and the amending process, defeat of what the public wants defeated is just as
                much a success as the victory of what the public wants victorious. Even where a majority-- but not a sufficient
                majority, or not a majority so distributed as to produce victory-- wishes to have an amendment (or the over-riding of a
                presidential veto of legislation), but is thwarted from doing so, the absence of any serious effort to change the
                constitutional rules suggests that the public does not regard the whole process as a failure-- that is, they accept the
                verdict of the enduring majorities who have sanctioned this procedure as a brake against their own transitory majority.</p>
                <p>Social changes-- even changes of a profound and far-reaching nature-- do not of course necessarily require changes in
                the US. Constitution. Many statutes and state constitutions serve as instruments of change, as do an ever‑increasing
                number of administrative agencies at all levels of government, and an ever-expanding galaxy of private individual and
                corporate arrangements. The proposition that publicly desired changes are thwarted for lack of institutional
                instruments, so that judges are the public's last resort, not only flies in the face of this evidence but is also
                inconsistent with the courts' plummeting prestige as they putatively carried out the public's otherwise thwarted desires
                for change. Not all advocates of judicial activism take on the formidable task of claiming that the public wants the
                changes imposed by judges. Some admit to speaking for a much narrower constituency among their contemporaries, however
                much they may anticipate vindication from later and presumably more enlightened generations. Justice Thurgood Marshall
                has made the test what the public would believe if properly informed.<a id="seventy-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-71" alt="note 71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
                <p>In principle, the fundamental justification for judicial activism is that what is imposed is morally preferable to what
                exists-- or what the public wants. In Ronald Dworkin's words, "a more equal society is a better society even if its
                citizens prefer inequality."<a id="seventy-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-72" alt="note 72"><sup>72</sup></a> This puts the issue at its clearest. What remains is to determine why judges are the
                proper instruments of changes counter to public desires and unauthorized by the source of their authority. The pragmatic
                answer is that they are appointed rather than elected and, with federal judges, appointed for life. Even so, different
                kinds of institutions have their own advantages and disadvantages,<a id="seventy-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-73" alt="note 73"><sup>73</sup></a> so that even intellectually or morally superior
                individuals in a particular kind of institution need not make more socially beneficial decisions when over-riding the
                decisions of other institutions which have social advantages in the particular matters within their respective purviews.</p>
                <p>Dworkin's dictum is instructive in another sense as well. To him, and to many other advocates of judicial activism, the
                issue is what to do-- not who is to decide what to do. To this latter question, as to many others, the mere fact of
                "change" has little relevance.</p>
                <p>The oft-repeated dichotomy between judicial activism and perpetuating the social and political world of the Framers of
                the Constitution defies history as well as logic. Some of the most dramatic changes-- indeed, drastic transformations of
                the whole social and political landscape of the United States-- occurred in the first century under the Constitution,
                which is to say, before Earl Warren was born. Few of these transformations were caused by judicial decisions, and the
                most historic social transformation of all-- the freeing of the black population from slavery-- went counter to the most
                prominent judicial opinion of that era on race, the Dred Scott decision. The choice between judicial activism and
                perpetuating the eighteenth century represents either incredible naiveté as a belief or incredible cynicism as an
                argument.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">Morality</h4>
                <p>Although some argue as if the moral issue in judicial interpretation is whether, or to what degree, morality is to
                influence the law-- as if it were a controversy between "moral skeptics" who believe that "morality may be ignored"<a id="seventy-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-74" alt="note 74"><sup>74</sup></a>
                and those who wish the law to be applied with moral sensitivity-- the more fundamental question is not what to decide
                but who is to decide. Emphatic reiteration of the theme of morality, like emphatic reiteration of the theme of "change,"
                is not a substitute for determining whose morality-or, analogously, whose change, whose meaning, whose purposes, whose
                intent. The question is not whether rights should be "taken seriously"<a id="seventy-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-75" alt="note 75"><sup>75</sup></a> but whose conception of rights-- there being
                some conceptions of rights which are the very negation of rights as conceived by others.<a id="seventy-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-76" alt="note 76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
                <p>The morality of the law as enacted must be distinguished from the morality of the judge interpreting it. Justice Holmes
                was as insistent on the central and legitimate role of the former as he was on the irrelevance and illegitimacy of the
                latter. Whether or not one agrees with Holmes' substantive conclusion, the point here is simply that he demonstrated a
                viable distinction. Holmes was not "for" or "against" the generic principle of morality in the law. When discussing the
                development of law from a philosophical perspective, Holmes called it "the witness and external deposit of our moral
                life" and described its history as "the history of the moral development of the race."<a id="seventy-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-77" alt="note 77"><sup>77</sup></a> He also referred to "high
                idealizing" in general as "the best thing in man."<a id="seventy-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-78" alt="note 78"><sup>78</sup></a> But, as a member of the Supreme Court, he often said to his fellow
                jurists: "I hate justice"-- as an argument to be weighed by them in the context in which they were working.<a id="seventy-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-79" alt="note 79"><sup>79</sup></a> One of his
                dissenting opinions ended: "I am not at liberty to consider the justice of the Act."<a id="eighty" class="scrollto" href="#n-80" alt="note 80"><sup>80</sup></a> Similarly, when writing to a
                foreign jurist, Holmes said: "I always should be sorry if I could not get any reason more definite than in consonance
                with our sense of justice." The real question, according to Holmes, is "does this decision represent what the law-making
                power must be taken to want?"<a id="eighty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-81" alt="note 81"><sup>81</sup></a> Similarly, in a dissenting opinion, Holmes declared: "When we know what the source of
                the law has said that it shall be, our authority is at an end."<a id="eighty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-82" alt="note 82"><sup>82</sup></a> In his later years, Holmes contemplated writing a book
                on the law, "getting rid of all talk of duties and rights-- beginning with the definition of law in the lawyer's sense
                as a statement of circumstances in which the public force will be brought to bear on a man through the Courts …"<a id="eighty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-83" alt="note 83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
                <p>In this context, Holmes cannot be depicted as a judicial defender of the "substantive value" of free speech, or any
                other moral value. He was a defender of the Constitution, as the ultimate source of the power he wielded, and the
                Constitution was the defender of free speech. On the Supreme Court bench, Holmes did not deem himself the agent of any
                moral values transcending the Constitution. Rather, he saw his judicial role as being "to see that the game is played
                according to the rules whether I like them or not."<a id="eighty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-84" alt="note 84"><sup>84</sup></a> When he said that the Constitution did not enact Herbert Spencer's
                philosophy, that was not a rejection of Spencer's philosophy. Unlike some other critics of judicial activism, Holmes
                rejected activism, even when based on his own philosophy. The Constitution, he said, "is not intended to embody a
                particular economic theory." More generally: "It is made for people of fundamentally differing views."<a id="eighty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-85" alt="note 85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
                <p>What is at issue between those who urge judicial restraint and those who urge judicial activism is not whether there is,
                or should be, morality in the law. What is at issue is the institutional source of that morality. A contemporary
                exponent of judicial restraint, Judge Robert H. Bork, has summarized the argument in terms very similar to those of
                Holmes: "In a constitutional democracy, the moral content of the law must be given by the morality of the framer or the
                legislator, never by the morality of the judge."<a id="eighty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-86" alt="note 86"><sup>86</sup></a> Once again, it is necessary to state the position of the advocates of
                judicial restraint at some length because the opposing views of the judicial activists do not simply disagree with their
                premises, reasoning, or conclusions, but often debate an entirely different range of issues-- whether or to what extent
                there should be morality in the law, what kind of morality it should be (utilitarian, contractarian, etc.), and the
                moral bases of disobedience of the law, for example.<a id="eighty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-87" alt="note 87"><sup>87</sup></a> It is difficult to get the issues between them joined, much less
                resolved.</p>
                <p>It has been argued by Ronald Dworkin, for example, that those with a "rule book" conception of law "do not care about
                the content of the rules in the rule book"<a id="eighty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-88" alt="note 88"><sup>88</sup></a>-- as if the issue were one of relative caring rather than the institutional
                locus of discretion. While conceding the value of prospective rules, Dworkin says, "compliance with the rule book is
                plainly not sufficient for justice; full compliance will achieve very great injustice if the rules are unjust."<a id="eighty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-89" alt="note 89"><sup>89</sup></a> No one
                can doubt that; one need only conceive of being a judge in South Africa, Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union. The real
                question is whether that is the issue.</p>
                <p>Such societies are condemned precisely because their laws and policies are considered unjust, and those who in
                conscience resign from positions which require them to act as agents of such laws and policies are applauded. The moral
                problem is with the nature of such regimes, not with the nature of agency. The larger question-- and the real point of
                contention-- is not how individuals should respond to institutionalized injustice already in place, but how institutions
                can function to better the human condition. It is moral preening to suggest that those who favor one method of
                institutional decision-making "care" more about justice (or other "substantive values") than those who think another
                method of institutional decision-making will prove more effective. What must be analyzed and debated are the reasons for
                believing that one institutional pattern will advance justice-- or any other goal-- more effectively than another.</p>
                <p>It can be, and has been, debated for centuries whether specialized roles, strictly observed, contribute more to human
                well-being than more expansive responsibility for the common good being directly assumed by each individual. Arguments
                for "social responsibility" by businessmen are, in this sense, parallel to arguments for judicial activism, liberation
                theology, or advocacy journalism.<a id="ninety" class="scrollto" href="#n-90" alt="note 90"><sup>90</sup></a> These are all questions about the scope, mode, and locus of institutional
                discretion-- not about who cares more about justice or any other moral precept. Oliver Wendell Holmes, born during the
                era of slavery, was an abolitionist who left college to volunteer to fight in the Civil War, where he was severely
                wounded in two battles. This was hardly moral agnosticism. Even when serving, years later, on the U.S. Supreme Court
                Holmes publicly voiced strong opinions on the political ideologies of his day<a id="ninety-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-91" alt="note 91"><sup>91</sup></a>-- though his votes on the Court often
                went in favor of those whose ideas he repudiated and anathematized.<a id="ninety-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-92" alt="note 92"><sup>92</sup></a> Moral neutrality has nothing to do with defining
                the limits of a judge's institutional role.</p>
                <p>Judicial activists like Ronald Dworkin and Laurence H. Tribe recognize limits on what judges can and should do when
                interpreting the Constitution.<a id="ninety-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-93" alt="note 93"><sup>93</sup></a> They simply set those limits much wider than do Robert H. Bork or Richard Posner today,
                or Holmes or Blackstone in times past. It is the nature of the differential which is at issue. Professor Tribe distanced
                himself from those advocates of judicial activism "who have convinced themselves that 'anything goes' as long as it
                helps end what they see as injustice; that constitutional law is only a legitimating mask for what those in power can
                get away with; or that it is only tame language in which those who might otherwise foment violent revolution can couch
                their demands in forms the regime might accept without losing face."<a id="ninety-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-94" alt="note 94"><sup>94</sup></a> In short, Professor Tribe rejected guerrilla
                warfare under the guise of legal theory. He said:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We must make choices but must renounce the equally illusory freedom to choose however we might wish to choose. For it is
                    a Constitution-- a specific, necessarily imperfect Constitution-- in whose terms we are, after all, choosing.<a id="ninety-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-95" alt="note 95"><sup>95</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Constitution, according to Tribe, "is not simply a mirror, nor is it an empty vessel whose users may pour into it
                whatever they will."<a id="ninety-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-96" alt="note 96"><sup>96</sup></a> But, however Professor Tribe may differ in degree from some other advocates of judicial activism,
                he shares a common feature with most-- a quest for the substantive moral values behind the cognitive meaning of
                constitutional provisions. It is in terms of these underlying values that the individual appellate judge must make
                choices when deciding cases-- "constitutional choices," as Professor Tribe calls them. To Tribe, "the Constitution is
                inevitably substantive." "A substantive concern for individual privacy necessarily underpins the Fourth Amendment," he
                says.<a id="ninety-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-97" alt="note 97"><sup>97</sup></a> After examining a number of constitutional provisions, Tribe concludes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is puzzling is that anyone can say, in the face of this reality, that the Constitution is or should be
                    predominantly concerned with process and not substance.<a id="ninety-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-98" alt="note 98"><sup>98</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>What is at least equally puzzling is why there should be such insistently reiterated emphasis on the existence of moral
                substance underlying constitutional provisions, in the absence of any contrary claim that it is an amoral document with
                no social purpose. The mere existence of The Federalist Papers would surely be sufficient refutation, if any such
                hypothetical doctrine should arise. Once again, the issue that is not joined is the issue actually raised by their
                opponents: Why are judges authorized to revise moral decisions already made and ratified, and presented as instructions
                rather than suggestions or exhortations-- presented as "Congress shall make no law . . . " rather than "Congress should
                weigh the following," much less "Judges should weigh the following . . . "?</p>
                <p>In any document (or situation, philosophy, institution, population, equation) involving many factors, nothing is easier
                than to abstract from factors A through Y and then declare that Z is the truly crucial variable to consider. Because the
                Constitution has a moral dimension, this procedure can make plausible the non sequitur that it must be read and
                interpreted as a moral statement. But because Beethoven wore clothes, it does not follow that his significance must be
                assessed sartorially-- or that those who consider his apparel irrelevant are claiming that he was a nudist. Establishing
                a particular fact is not establishing its salience for a particular purpose. Establishing that the Constitution was not
                morally nude does not make the judge's role that of its fashion designer. Judicial activists who depict the Constitution
                as a morally groping document, crying out plaintively for the aid of judges,<a id="ninety-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-99" alt="note 99"><sup>99</sup></a> have nothing on which to base this
                vision, other than their own self-serving assumptions. Although a junkyard owner may choose to regard General Motors as
                his raw material supplier, that in no way justifies imputing to General Motors an "original intent" to play such a role.</p>
                <p>The call for "constitutional choices"<a id="hundred" class="scrollto" href="#n-100" alt="note 100"><sup>100</sup></a> likewise evades or pre-empts a crucial issue: Are there in fact choices to be
                made, in the sense suggested? Judges can certainly assess processes, as the advocates of judicial restraint urge, but
                can they choose results in the manner suggested by Professor Tribe? The difference can be illustrated with the
                best-known (and most traumatic) episode of the twentieth century: World War II. Central to Adolf Hitler's ambitions,
                which led to this war, were (1) the desire for a territorially more expanded Germany, including the Germanic peoples of
                Austria and of the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia, as the centerpiece of an international empire, and (2) the
                disappearance of the Jews as a people. The net results of Hitler's endeavors, however, were (1) a reduction of Germany's
                territory to a smaller size than when he took power in 1933, with this smaller Germany then being further split in two
                between Eastern and Western political blocs, and (2) creation of the state of Israel. During the prewar era, Neville
                Chamberlain's choice was "peace in our time," but the processes he followed have often been blamed for producing--
                unnecessarily-- the greatest carnage in history. These examples are meant to be illustrative as to a distinction, rather
                than conclusive as to history.<a id="hundred-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-101" alt="note 101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
                <p>Contrasts between intentions and results are not confined to the twentieth century. There are ancient and fundamental
                differences of beliefs as to the extent to which man's intentions are realized or realizable-- differences manifest in
                controversies involving some of the leading intellectual figures of the Western world over the past two centuries, at
                least.<a id="hundred-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-102" alt="note 102"><sup>102</sup></a> Yet Professor Tribe pre-empts this whole issue with his doctrine that judges make choices among results.<a id="hundred-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-103" alt="note 103"><sup>103</sup></a>
                But it is by no means clear from the empirical record that judicial activism in the area of ethnic minority issues, for
                example, has improved these groups' over-all economic position vis-a-vis the society as a whole, and substantial
                evidence that poorer minorities have fallen further behind as judges have bent the law to advance them.<a id="hundred-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-104" alt="note 104"><sup>104</sup></a> It is not
                necessary to regard such evidence as conclusive proof of counter-productive results in this case or in general. It is
                sufficient to indicate that whether judges can in fact make choices of results is an issue, rather than a foregone
                conclusion. Both Dworkin and Tribe repeatedly treat the assumptions and the results of the courts' racial and ethnic
                decisions as foregone conclusions.<a id="hundred-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-105" alt="note 105"><sup>105</sup></a> Their reiterated insistence that judges should choose results based on moral
                principles contrasts sharply with their gliding silently over the prior question of whether judges can choose social
                results, whether on moral or any other bases.</p>
                <p>Once the analysis recognizes the distinction between choosing processes and choosing results-- that is, once it takes
                account of the fact that people are profoundly mistaken a significant part of the time-- then the question of
                institutional locus of discretion involves not simply the relative prescience of the various people but also, and more
                importantly, the ability of differing institutions to correct initially mistaken beliefs in the light of subsequent
                experience. Courts are among the institutions least able to monitor continuously the ramifications of their decisions
                and least subject to incentives to admit being wrong, much less to violate their own precedents and change.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">Majorities</h4>
                <p>Institutionally, majorities are important as the source of power in a democracy, a portion of which power is wielded by
                judges, at the sufferance of those majorities. There are moral choices to be confronted by any individual before
                agreeing to act as the agent of any constituency or organization, unless he accepts the role in the spirit of a
                guerrilla operating behind enemy lines, but that is very different from saying that he is an agent of abstract moral
                principles, set above the source of his power. As an individual, he may indeed view some moral principles as
                representing a higher level of morality than the principles embodied in the law he is authorized to enforce. But the
                distinction between unfettered individual freedom of conscience in belief and the very real moral constraints of duty in
                action was made by Socrates when he drank the hemlock.<a id="hundred-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-106" alt="note 106"><sup>106</sup></a> It was not moral neutrality.</p>
                <p>The agency role of a judge is, in principle, as applicable in a monarchy as in a republic, but in a constitutional
                democracy the additional issue of the people's right of self-government is involved. There would, of course, be no
                constitutional rights if every transitory majority had unlimited discretion. But that does not make the issue one of
                majority versus minority, or majority versus morality, much less majority versus judge. The thwarting of the popular
                will, as it exists at a given time, is inherent in enforcing statutes representing other popular wills at other times,
                or constitutional provisions representing more enduring popular wills, which include the reining in of transitory
                popular wills. None of this implies the raising of minorities, or judges, or moral principles interpreted by judges,
                above the majority. The question is: which majority-- a mob gathered in the streets, the "silent majority" in their
                homes and workplaces, the past majorities who passed laws against mob violence, or the many generations who have each
                given in turn the "contemporary ratification" of the Constitution which judicial activists regard as the special
                province of judges? The federal Constitution is "the supreme law of the land," not because it is more moral than state
                constitutions or state or federal legislative enactments, but because it represents a larger and more enduring
                majority.<a id="hundred-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-107" alt="note 107"><sup>107</sup></a> Minorities receive their constitutional rights from that enduring majority to which transient majorities
                bow, not from whatever abstract moral rights are imagined to exist as a brooding omnipresence in the sky.</p>
                <p>No one believes that whatever a majority does is morally right‑- including the majority. But the morality of the terms
                of a charter delegating authority is a very different question from the morality of one's use of that delegated
                authority. It is the latter question which lies within the official discretion of those who accept delegated authority,
                if they accept it in good faith. Dworkin recognizes no such moral limitation on the authority delegated to judges. He
                argues that the Supreme Court "must define the best conception of democracy for itself."<a id="hundred-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-108" alt="note 108"><sup>108</sup></a> But the Supreme Court is
                hardly in a Rawlsian "original position" to determine such matters. It is an existing institution under an existing
                government, one of whose tendencies or dimensions is democratic. Each individual can decide whether that government is
                good, bad, or indifferent when deciding whether or not to accept appointment to the bench-- and when contemplating
                resignation. But neither individual justices nor the Supreme Court as an institution have a mandate to determine de novo
                whether the government is democratic enough or democratic in the right way. Usurping such a role is operating as a
                guerrilla behind enemy lines.</p>
                <p>The larger question is for the whole society to consider: How just are the specifics of the law, and how secure are the
                legal rights granted? The presumed tenuousness of majority-based rights ignores the majority's own recognition, in a
                constitutional democracy, of moral principles superior to its own current inclinations-- even if it refuses to grant
                such superiority a priori to the current inclinations of others. Free speech is politically important as part of the
                process of changing the majority's mind. Rights granted by a majority may, of course, be revoked by a majority-- but so
                ultimately may rights created and granted by judges. Constitutional rights have a protective legitimacy which has
                sustained them for two centuries, despite numerous popular disagreements with particular judicial decisions.
                Surreptitiously created rights, lacking that politically protective legitimacy, invite circumvention and stake their
                endurance on popular reluctance to impeach judges or disrespect laws, or to dismantle parts of the constitutional
                structure. That is, they raise the stakes, in hopes of forcing the opposition to fold their hand. It is a dangerous and
                unnecessary gamble with the future of constitutional government. Moreover, judges who act like guerrillas behind enemy
                lines have no moral claim to exemption from the fate of guerrillas discovered behind enemy lines. At a minimum,
                guerrillas have no moral claim to tenure.</p>
                <p>Those who argue for a judicial fusion of moral and legal principles once again confuse the question of what to decide
                with the prior question of who is to decide. Issues of justifying a particular institutional locus of discretion, which
                are so often glided over in the arguments of judicial activists, are central to the arguments of those advocating
                judicial restraint. Legal rights and moral rights cannot be fused in the latter vision, for they relate to entirely
                different processes-- hence Holmes' distress that they were described by the same word. According to Holmes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>… for legal purposes a right is only the hypostasis of a prophecy-- the imagination of a substance supporting the fact
                    that the public force will be brought to bear upon those said to contravene it-- just as we talk of the force of
                    gravitation accounting for the conduct of bodies in space. One phrase adds no more than the other to what we know
                    without it. No doubt behind these legal rights is the fighting will of the subject to maintain them, and the spread of
                    his emotions to the general rules by which they are maintained, but that does not seem to me the same thing as the
                    supposed a priori discernment of a duty or the assertion of a pre-existing right. A dog will fight for his bone.<a id="hundred-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-109" alt="note 109"><sup>109</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, to Holmes rights are the creation of governments, and the emotional attachment felt toward these rights
                indicate nothing to the contrary, nor even anything specifically human. The opposite view of Professor Dworkin is that
                "citizens have moral rights against their governments."<a id="hundred-ten" class="scrollto" href="#n-110" alt="note 110"><sup>110</sup></a> These moral rights are "made into legal rights by the
                Constitution."<a id="hundred-eleven" class="scrollto" href="#n-111" alt="note 111"><sup>111</sup></a> Thus "we must treat the First Amendment as an attempt to protect a moral right."<a id="hundred-twelve" class="scrollto" href="#n-112" alt="note 112"><sup>112</sup></a> Behind all these
                rights is "the vague but powerful idea of human dignity," that "there are ways of treating a man that are inconsistent
                with recognizing him as a full member of the human community," which "holds that such treatment is profoundly
                unjust."<a id="hundred-thirteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-113" alt="note 113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
                <p>The concept of "government" is used here by Dworkin in the same timeless and inconsistent way "majority" is used in
                other contexts by judicial activists. Government in the form of a particular administration at a given point in history
                prohibited all future administrations from doing certain things-- and subsequent administrations have been unwilling or
                unable to get these prohibitions repealed. Far from being abstract rights of individuals against government, based on
                nebulous moral presumptions, these prohibitions are products of government and rights of the government itself, as an
                enduring institution, against its transient agents, whose violations of these prohibitions may lead not only to having
                their orders countermanded, but also to impeachment, removal from office, and punishment by civil and criminal
                penalties. The fact that the transient agents of government usually have the prudence to change course, once a violation
                of constitutional principles has been detected, means that this scenario is seldom played out in full, but nevertheless
                it remains the powerful threat behind the scenario that is actually played out, under the guise of some aggrieved
                "individual citizen" versus "the government." It was precisely the threat of "the government" which forced its highest
                official to resign in 1974. It is the threat of "the government" which forces its other agents to respect the rights of
                "the individual."</p>
                <p>While democratically elected administrations are bound by the cognitive meanings of prior government, judges are somehow
                assumed to be exempt, and to be authorized to re-open the whole range of constitutional issues and reasons-- not all of
                them purely questions of morality‑- settled long ago. Even if all constitutional provisions could be shown to be based
                solely on moral essences of the sort discussed by Professor Dworkin, the question of locus of discretion would remain:
                Why are today's judges authorized-- and by whom?-- to re-open these questions? Is mere use of the magic incantations
                "unclear" and "ambiguous" sufficient to open the doors to the enormous power of remaking government? As the Weber case
                demonstrated, anything can be made "unclear."</p>
                <p>The idea that rights have their origin in the "dignity" of the individual as a member of the human community treats
                "membership" as a one-way, free, and irrevocable grant-- contrary to what membership means in almost any other context,
                where those who fail to carry out the duties of a member forfeit their membership. It is commonplace that those who
                refuse to pay their dues or obey the rules cease to be members. At one time the law distinguished between those within
                its protection and "outlaws" who had been placed-- or placed themselves-- beyond its protection. If rules are more than
                arbitrary enactments and serve some social purpose, to limit the retaliatory consequences of disobeying them while the
                direct consequences to society remain unlimited means giving some individuals the ability to impose high costs on others
                at low costs to themselves. Concepts of "dignity" and "respect," as free goods available to all, empty them of meaning
                as differential rankings of people in response to their own respective behavior. Again, the net effect is to enable some
                to impose costs on others without corresponding costs being imposed on themselves. Granting differential privileges to
                persons conceived separately as "individuals" than when they are conceived collectively as "the majority" seems
                arbitrary at best-- and worse than arbitrary when the basis of selecting such beneficiaries is that they violated rules.</p>
                <p>Much of the moral force for favoring "the individual" over "society" or "the majority" comes from contemplating the fate
                of disadvantaged racial or ethnic minorities-which is to say, minorities defined by characteristics beyond the
                individual's control, as distinguished from minorities defined by the individual's own behavior (homosexuals,
                alcoholics, or-- in principle-- pilots or doctors). Moral condemnation of racial discrimination, however richly deserved
                in many lands around the world, is not the same as an argument that legal rights must be created by judges to stand
                between all minorities-- behaviorally as well as genetically defined-- and the will of the majority. To say that a moral
                right exists is not to say that a legal right exists, or that judges are authorized to create one not already in the
                Constitution.</p>
                <p>Generalization from the history of racial minorities is often false as history as well. Historically, the ending of the
                enslavement of blacks in the United States was not the work of courts but of a democratically elected president (who was
                subsequently re-elected) and of majorities sufficient to pass a series of constitutional amendments in a few years,
                granting both freedom and equality before the law. The implementation of this legal equality was retarded for decades by
                the courts' restrictive reading of the Fourteenth Amendment in racial cases, while they read the Amendment ever more
                expansively in areas remote from the "original intent" of the enactment. Depiction of courts as the last bastion of
                morality against the immoralities of the democratic process requires highly selective samples of history.</p>
                <p>The history of racial minorities is instructive in yet another way related to controversies over the institutional locus
                of discretion. Much of the controversy proceeds as if the important decisions-- and the important changes-‑ are due to
                collective decisions, centered in political institutions, with the issue then being where in such institutions the
                controversies should be decided. In reality, many of the most profound advances of racial and ethnic minorities around
                the world have occurred independently of political or legal changes‑- and often precisely to the extent that collective
                controls were inoperative or inefficient.</p>
                <p>Racial residential integration, for example, was far greater in many American cities half a century before racially
                restrictive covenants were abolished by Shelley v. Kramer<a id="hundred-fourteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-114" alt="note 114"><sup>114</sup></a> than at any time since.<a id="hundred-fifteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-115" alt="note 115"><sup>115</sup></a> The increase of blacks in
                high‑level occupations was greater in the decade preceding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than in the decade following its
                enactment.<a id="hundred-sixteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-116" alt="note 116"><sup>116</sup></a> Many groups have prospered far more when ignored by the authorities than when made the subject of their
                attention-- the Jews, the Chinese, the Indians, and the Japanese being classic examples in countries around the world.
                More than selective historical examples are involved. Economic analysis has demonstrated logical reasons why the
                systemic actions of the marketplace are often more favorable to disadvantaged minorities then are the actions of
                government, and a growing body of empirical evidence supports that theoretical analysis.<a id="hundred-seventeen" class="scrollto" href="#n-117" alt="note 117"><sup>117</sup></a> Whether or not the economic
                theory or the factual evidence is accepted as conclusive, at the very least they seriously undermine the foregone
                conclusion that the decisions which matter most-- and most beneficially-- are the collective decisions, made through
                political or legal processes. If judicial activists wish to maintain this essential underlying premise, then it must be
                supported by evidence rather than by presumption and reiteration.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">POLITICAL VARIETIES OF ACTIVISM</h4>
                <p>Much current discussion pits "liberal judicial activism" against "conservative judicial restraint." As loose labels,
                these are not entirely without foundation. Indeed, it is worth exploring what that foundation is. But it is at least
                equally important to recognize that neither logic nor history inevitably ties the issue of judicial activism to a
                particular political or social creed. This is especially so when discussing a particular constitutional system already
                in place, as distinguished from deciding what kind of legal structure to have, as the framers of the Constitution did in
                1787.</p>
                <p>When Chief Justice Taney said, in the Dred Scott case, that a black man "had no rights which the white man was bound to
                respect,"<a id="hundred-eighteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-118" alt="note 118"><sup>118</sup></a> he was ruling on the basis of substantive values, not process-- and so must be classed with the judicial
                activists, however much modern liberals might resent the company. When courts of the "substantive due process" era
                struck down much government regulation, they were making "constitutional choices" in the manner urged by Professor
                Tribe-- though not with the same social philosophy as Professor Tribe. Already there are fears being expressed that
                judges will in future be appointed on the basis of substantive values which include prayer in school and outlawing
                abortions‑- fears not only as to the particular policy issues involved, but fears as to an immoral corruption of the
                judicial process, often expressed by people who have long supported and applauded liberal judicial activism.</p>
                <p>In short, judicial activism can cut many ways ideologically, though many who have argued for it proceed as if it is
                their own kind of "substantive values," "constitutional choices," and "change" which it entails. Once it is recognized
                that these phrases can have radically different content ideologically, they no longer represent goals-whether good, bad,
                or indifferent in themselves-- but rather a process which can amount to a judicial war of each against all. Whoever
                might win ideologically, if anyone does, the law and the society lose. A dependable framework of legal expectations,
                achieved after centuries of painful and bloody struggles, would be sacrificed, while a whole society retrogressed toward
                a world where edicts are simply issued by whoever has the power at the moment. This is, of course, not the goal of
                anyone on either side of the controversy-only the logic of allowing a degree of judicial freedom for some purposes which
                is just as readily usable for opposite purposes.</p>
                <p>While judicial activism is in principle adaptable to any ideological program-- and in practice likely to be adopted by
                its current ideological enemies if it proves to be politically unstoppable-- it is nevertheless "no accident" that the
                principled argument for judicial activism has been made largely by those with a particular social vision. The
                assumptions of that vision make judicial activism both feasible and desirable, in a way in which it is not desirable to
                those with different assumptions about the nature of man and of social causation. While people with all sorts of
                philosophies may practice judicial activism surreptitiously, an explicit advocacy or justification for judicial activism
                is not compatible with all assumptions or social visions.</p>
                <p>The kind of man conceived by those who have historically advocated judicial restraint is a very different creature from
                the kind of man envisioned by those who urge judicial activism. The kinds of societies and institutions appropriate to
                these two kinds of creatures, called by the same name, necessarily differ-- just as an ideal society for whales would
                differ from an ideal society for ants or eagles.</p>
                <p>Those with a highly constrained vision of man's capabilities-- both mental and moral-- seek institutions and
                institutional roles which confine the discretion of each individual to a small circle, within which he may be competent,
                rather than let his decisions roam over vast reaches, where all are certain to be incompetent. Blackstone's vision of
                man was that "his reason is corrupt, and his understanding full of ignorance and error." Given "the frailty, the
                imperfection, and the blindness of human reason,"<a id="hundred-nineteen" class="scrollto" href="#n-119" alt="note 119"><sup>119</sup></a> Blackstone's desire to keep judges on a short leash was
                understandable. All institutional roles are confined in this vision, the boundaries of specialties (morality and law,
                for example) respected, and the specialist deferred to within his realm. "I revere men in the functions which belong to
                them," Burke said.<a id="hundred-twenty" class="scrollto" href="#n-120" alt="note 120"><sup>120</sup></a> He too had a very constrained vision of human capabilities.<a id="hundred-twenty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-121" alt="note 121"><sup>121</sup></a> So did Oliver Wendell Holmes,<a id="hundred-twenty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-122" alt="note 122"><sup>122</sup></a>
                who said, "We need specialists even more than we do civilized men"<a id="hundred-twenty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-123" alt="note 123"><sup>123</sup></a>-- these "civilized men" being defined in this
                context as elite generalists who "are a little apt to think that they cannot breathe the American atmosphere."<a id="hundred-twenty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-124" alt="note 124"><sup>124</sup></a>
                Specialization was also central to the economic theories of Adam Smith<a id="hundred-twenty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-125" alt="note 125"><sup>125</sup></a>-- another social thinker with a very
                constrained vision of man.<a id="hundred-twenty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-126" alt="note 126"><sup>126</sup></a> Specialization has in general been the hallmark of the constrained vision, whether in law,
                economics, politics, or philosophy.</p>
                <p>In short, man's competence does not extend far enough for him to be trusted with other than limited responsibilities,
                according to the constrained vision. Judicial restraint is only a special application of this general principle. The
                businessman is likewise not to attempt to exercise "social responsibility," according to this view,<a id="hundred-twenty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-127" alt="note 127"><sup>127</sup></a> but to run his
                own particular business as efficiently as he can. The broad authority necessarily given to political and legal
                institutions was acceptable to those with this vision insofar as it consisted essentially of defining the boundaries of
                others' discretion-- not second-guessing them within those boundaries.<a id="hundred-twenty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-128" alt="note 128"><sup>128</sup></a> This meant defining the rules of a process,
                within which others would exercise substantive discretion, according to their more competent specific knowledge and
                varying individual values.</p>
                <p>This whole vision of law, and of social processes in general, becomes very different when the key assumptions of the
                constrained vision are dropped. Then it becomes possible to conceive of a wider scope for the discretion of those who
                control social processes, judges being just one example. Specialization of knowledge and of social function can become
                far less important than the general moral and intellectual stature of those making social decisions. When Ronald Dworkin
                wrote of "a fusion of moral and legal theory,"<a id="hundred-twenty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-129" alt="note 129"><sup>129</sup></a> he echoed a long tradition in which, for example, Thorstein Veblen
                lamented the (to him) needless boundaries between the social sciences,<a id="hundred-thirty" class="scrollto" href="#n-130" alt="note 130"><sup>130</sup></a> and in which numerous other social thinkers
                considered the running of a business to be something to be readily done by political authorities or their appointees, or
                by others with no great specialized training or experience."<a id="hundred-thirty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-131" alt="note 131"><sup>131</sup></a> This melding of different disciplines and roles is quite
                different from Holmes' urging of legal practitioners to learn economics,<a id="hundred-thirty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-132" alt="note 132"><sup>132</sup></a> which did not imply any "interdisciplinary"
                blurring of lines between the two fields.</p>
                <p>The issue between the two social visions is not whether most people have broad or narrow abilities. The issue is whether
                man as such has inherently very limited moral and intellectual potential-- the "brightest and best" as well as the
                masses. Where the constrained vision of human nature is fundamental to the analysis, then the systemic coordination of
                experience is essential-- and tapping the brilliance or moral dedication of an elite is incidental."<a id="hundred-thirty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-133" alt="note 133"><sup>133</sup></a> In this vision,
                maintaining diffused loci of discretion is more important that the intellectual principles or moral commitment of any
                individual or institution, judicial or otherwise. The constrained vision is concerned primarily with processes-- with
                institutional incentives and restrictions-- and its watchwords are cast in process terms: "free enterprise," "judicial
                restraint," or "property rights." This contrasts with visions cast in terms of goals, such as "liberty, equality and
                fraternity," or "social justice," for example.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary here to attempt to resolve this conflict of visions. That would be a relevant task if we were back in
                1787 trying to create a Constitution. But now that a Constitution has endured for two hundred years, the issue is not
                whether it should have been constructed according to a constrained or an unconstrained vision. However it was
                constructed then, it is a fact of life today, and the question for today is whether it is to be changed-- by whom, and
                through what process? Consideration of the differing visions simply suggests reasons why those who want an expansive
                role for judges-- on principle-often share a set of moral and societal goals (summarized as "social justice"<a id="hundred-thirty-four" class="scrollto" href="#n-134" alt="note 134"><sup>134</sup></a>) quite
                different from those who favor judicial restraint. That is not saying that it is all just a question of one's ultimate
                presuppositions. That would have been true in 1787. It is not true today. The question for today is whether one chooses
                to continue to live under the existing constitutional government, which includes the right to urge changes, or to usurp
                the power to make changes unilaterally.</p>
                <p>The distinction between ad hoc judicial activism, according to the individual judge's own subjective inclinations, and
                "principled" judicial activism, according to some general moral theory, has been advanced to suggest that the latter is
                more moral. But ultimately this difference is one between retail and wholesale judicial activism-- the "principled"
                version being as much extrinsic to the Constitution as the ad hoc version, and no less a surreptitious usurpation.</p>
                <p>The case for judicial restraint is not that it will give unique "right answers" in each legal case. No such claim has
                ever been made for constitutional government in general, much less for one of its parts. The argument for judicial
                restraint in specific cases is that the inevitable variance from the ideal can be better kept within limits when the
                whole process is conceived as one of seeking boundaries of cognitive meaning for each concrete case as it arises, rather
                than weighing values derived from a multiplicity of ever-changing sources. The more general argument for judicial
                restraint is that, even when imperfectly observed, it has maintained a political legitimacy and public support which
                have enabled constitutional democracy to survive for two hundred years, while more ambitious forms of government have
                come and gone-- or have been able to survive only by draconian methods.</p>
                <p>Within the camp of those urging judicial restraint, there will of course be differences of opinion on specific cases and
                specific constitutional provisions. Some would read the "takings" clause of the Constitution, for example, to require
                compensation for implicit or partial takings of the value of property, even if the physical thing possessed remains with
                the original owner."<a id="hundred-thirty-five" class="scrollto" href="#n-135" alt="note 135"><sup>135</sup></a> Rent control laws, which can take more than 100 percent of the value of a building-- in the
                sense that it becomes an unsaleable liability rather than an asset<a id="hundred-thirty-six" class="scrollto" href="#n-136" alt="note 136"><sup>136</sup></a>-- are a classic example, though stringent zoning
                laws, confiscatory public utility rate-setting, and other governmental action can also destroy vast amounts of property
                values without changing legal title to physical things. Professor Richard Epstein's argument that these kinds of
                "takings" should be compensated from the public treasury, while based economically on efficiency and morally on
                considerations of justice, are based legally on an explicit provision already part of the Constitution, not on these
                "substantive values." Reading the same Constitution, Justice Holmes repeatedly-though not invariably-- upheld such
                government actions,<a id="hundred-thirty-seven" class="scrollto" href="#n-137" alt="note 137"><sup>137</sup></a> while not denying that they were indeed partial "takings."<a id="hundred-thirty-eight" class="scrollto" href="#n-138" alt="note 138"><sup>138</sup></a> According to Holmes, "The
                constitutional requirement of compensation when property is taken cannot be pressed to its grammatical extreme" for
                government must function and "some play must be allowed in the joints if the machine is to work."<a id="hundred-thirty-nine" class="scrollto" href="#n-139" alt="note 139"><sup>139</sup></a> The idea of a need
                for "play in the joints" appeared in Holmes' discussion of legal interpretation in general, as well as in specific
                cases.<a id="hundred-forty" class="scrollto" href="#n-140" alt="note 140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
                <p>The point here is not to weigh the relative merits of alternative readings of the "takings" clause. Rather, the point is
                simply that there may be alternative readings without recourse to arguments for "change," for judicially imposed
                morality, claims of textual ambiguity, or other principles or tactics of judicial activism. Moreover, Professor
                Epstein's reading would call for a court far more active in striking down legislative actions, without being any more
                "activist" than Holmes as far as constitutional interpretation was concerned. On the contrary, Holmes' "play in the
                joints" argument, whatever its merits legally or socially, is extrinsic to the constitutional text in a way in which
                Epstein's argument is not. Attempts to deny, ignore, or dismiss Professor Epstein's economic reasoning are not arguments
                over "black letter law" in the Constitution. Holmes in fact saw similar acts as "takings" in his day but often refused
                to strike them down, saying "property rights may be taken for public purposes if you do not take too much."<a id="hundred-forty-one" class="scrollto" href="#n-141" alt="note 141"><sup>141</sup></a> Like many
                legal issues, he saw it as a question of degree‑- and when "the extent of the taking is great,"<a id="hundred-forty-two" class="scrollto" href="#n-142" alt="note 142"><sup>142</sup></a> he struck it down.</p>
                <p>Questions of degree, and of conflicting rights, ensure that legal controversies will not come to an end, regardless of
                what interpretive principles or practices are chosen. That does not mean that the nature, magnitude, and dangers of
                these controversies are predestined. Judicial restraint is not meant to predetermine every decision but to safeguard
                constitutional government. Disagreements with particular judgments or judges do not imply disaffection toward the whole
                judicial process or with the political system in general. But a long span of "principled" judicial activism does raise
                that specter, for it means that judges have repudiated the very document which they demand that the rest of us respect--
                and which is the ultimate source of our deference, or even toleration, toward them.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h4>
                <p>The degree of difficulty of constitutional interpretation is not independent of what specifically it is that is being
                attempted. Discerning (1) the cognitive meaning of instructions is fundamentally different from weighing (2) what past
                and present values will produce the morally best social results, and both are very different from determining (3) the
                psychological state of those who wrote the law-- this last being so patently impossible on the face of it that elaborate
                arguments as to its difficulty<a id="hundred-forty-three" class="scrollto" href="#n-143" alt="note 143"><sup>143</sup></a> are absurd by their redundancy. When concrete cases are decided seriatim, it is
                sufficient in each case to determine if the specifics of that case fall inside or outside the boundaries of possible
                cognitive meanings of the instructions. Those who have set themselves the very different task of weighing values from
                various constitutional, statutory, and other sources, have taken on a much heavier responsibility, a more vaguely
                defined goal, and a quest without legal authorization.</p>
                <p>The ultimate issue between judicial activism and judicial restraint is the institutional locus of discretion, and no
                amount of insistence on the desirability of change or morality answers the question as to who is to decide what specific
                changes or what specific morality is needed. The institutional security of federal judges, appointed for life, may
                provide temptations for assuming this prerogative, without providing either moral or pragmatic justification. If no
                authorization is needed for judges to introduce "change," neither is it needed for generals and admirals to do the
                same-- as in fact happens in a number of countries. Judges can conduct limited coups d’etat surreptitiously, while a
                military coup is usually overt and sweeping. Nevertheless, the dangers to constitutional government are no less real in
                the long run from judicial activism-- both because of the cumulative effect of small usurpations and because small
                usurpations both generate pressures and provide the precedents for larger usurpations by others with different social
                visions.</p>
                <p>The claim that judicial activism is necessary to rescue us from bondage to the past-- from having the writers of the
                Constitution "rule us from the grave"-- defies both logic and history. There is no contest between the living and the
                dead. The contest is between those living individuals who wish to see control of change in judicial hands and those who
                wish to see it in other hands. There has been no argument that either statutory or constitutional laws are not to
                change. The only meaningful question is: Who is to change them? The reiterated emphasis on change, like the reiterated
                emphasis on morality, argues what is not at issue and glides over what is crucially at issue: Why are judges the
                authorized instrument? The original cognitive meaning of laws-- constitutional or statutory-- is important, not out of
                deference to the dead, but because that is the agreed‑upon meaning among the living, until they choose to make an open
                and explicit change-- not have one foisted on them by the verbal sleight-of‑hand of judges.</p>
                <p>Existing social philosophies and political alignments cannot be presupposed in discussions of long-run questions, such
                as constitutional interpretation. Even within the judiciary, differences in "substantive values" have been drastic over
                time, and by no means negligible even at a given time. The belief that a constitutional structure can be maintained
                while jurists with radically different visions make "substantive choices" within it seems dangerously similar to a
                belief that one can slide half-way down a slippery slope. The argument for judicial activism must stand or fall in
                general and enduring terms, not simply on whether some current political or social creed is considered so superior to
                competing creeds as to justify judges' decisions in its favor. It is ultimately not a question of the relative merits of
                particular political or social creeds but of the long-run consequences of opening the floodgates to the generic
                principle of constitutional decisions based on "substantive values." Once you have opened the floodgates, you cannot
                tell the water where to go.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">What must be rejected is precisely the general principle that judges' "substantive values" should govern constitutional
                decisions. Nor is anything fundamentally changed by saying that judges are only agents of general moral ideas, rather
                than their own personal inclinations. If the Constitution does not enact Herbert Spencer's Social Statics, neither does
                it enact John Stuart Mill's On Liberty or John Rawls' A Theory of Justice.</p>
