                        <p class="mb-0">For those unfamiliar with Sowell’s devastation of Political Correctness, these letters offer a sampling and a peek at
                        the human being behind it. For those familiar with his writing this little volume will strengthen their appreciation of
                        his contribution to American intellectual life. In a way, Tom Sowell is the George Orwell of our time.</p>

                        years of his letters to everyone from Milton Friedman to Vernon Jordan. Lo and behold, they’re every bit as
                        scintillating as you might suspect. His letters are both readable and profound. Tom Sowell is amazing!</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">A Man of Letters reveals some of the private side of the life and career of one of America’s true scholars. Sowell’s
                        correspondence provides testimony to the real compassion that can only have its roots in hard-minded dispassionate
                        analysis.</p>

                        with him. Ironic, as throughout my adult life I have hung on his every word, believing him to be the brightest man I
                        have ever known. These letters, over a span of forty-seven years, are a treasury of insight and reason. My only
                        complaint is that he chose not to include any from earlier than 1960.</p>
